This is the first release of a pure Java embedded GangliaService. Unlike many
other efforts, the GangliaService is a peer which both listens and reports
metrics.  This means that it is capable of provide load balanced reported from
soft state and can even be used as a substitute for gmond on operating systems
(such as Windows) to which gmond has not been ported.

The main entry point is GangliaService. It is trivial to setup with defaults and
you can easily register your own metrics collection classes to report out on your
application.

GangliaServer service = new GangliaService("MyService");
// Register to collect metrics.
service.addMetricCollector(new MyMetricsCollector());
// Join the ganglia network; Start collecting and reporting metrics.
service.run();

The following will return the default load balanced report, which contains
exactly the same information that you would get from gstat -a. You can also use
an alternative method signature to get a report based on your own list of metrics
and/or have the report sorted by the metric (or even a synthetic metric) of your
choice.

IHostReport[] hostReport = service.getHostReport();  

Have fun!
