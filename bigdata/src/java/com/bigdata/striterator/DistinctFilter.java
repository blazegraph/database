/**
 * A filter that imposes a DISTINCT constraint on the {@link ISolution}s
 * generated by an {@link IRule}. The filter is optimized if only a single
 * chunk is visited by the source iterator. Otherwise, the filter is implemented
 * using a {@link BTree} backed by a {@link TemporaryStore}.
 * <p>
 * When more than one chunk is processed, {@link ISolution}s are transformed
 * into unsigned byte[] keys. The {@link BTree} is tested for each such key. If
 * the key is NOT found, then it is inserted into the {@link BTree} and the
 * solution is passed by the filter. Otherwise the solution is rejected by the
 * filter. The backing {@link BTree} is closed when the filter is finalized, but
 * it will hold a hard reference to the {@link TemporaryStore} until then.
 * Solutions are processed in chunks for efficient ordered reads and writes on
 * the {@link BTree}.
 * 
 * @todo A statistical distinct filter can be implemented using bloom filter
 *       INSTEAD of a {@link BTree} but the bloom filter parameters MUST be
 *       choosen so as to make the possibility of a false positive sufficiently
 *       unlikely to satisify the application criteria. However, such a filter
 *       will always have a non-zero chance of incorrectly rejecting a solution
 *       when that solution has NOT been seen by the filter. Since the bloom
 *       filter can undergenerate, it could only be applied in very specialized
 *       circumstances, e.g., it might be Ok for text search.
