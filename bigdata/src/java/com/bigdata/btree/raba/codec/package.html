<p>
This package provides several implementations for coding keys and values in
found in a B+Tree node or leaf, including no coding, prefix coding, and 
canonical huffman coding (which preserves the lexical order of the uncoded
values for which the dictionary may be coded and transmitted in fewer bits).
