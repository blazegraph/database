<title>Persistent Object Index</title>

<p>
A b+tree designed to provide a persistence capable object index.  The object
index has the task of mapping int32 persistent object identifiers onto a slot
allocation from which the current version of the object may be read.  The object
index is also the mechanism by which transaction isolation is provided.  Within
a transaction, operations are isolated by the transaction's object index.  If an
object identifier is not found in the transactions object index then it reads
through to an read-only object index.  However, changes are made within the
transaction's object index.  After a transaction has validated, the changes
isolated within its object index are merged down onto the then current object
index, producing a new object index whose root is stored in the root block of
the store.
</p>

<p>
Since the object index maps object identifiers to slots, it can not use persistent
identifies itself when storing its state.  Further, since isolation requires that
historical states of the object index are immutable (until they can be discarded),
the object index uses copy-on-write semantics when bringing an immutable index node
into a writable context.  There are exactly two contexts in which this occurs.  First,
when performing otherwise unisolated changes on the store.  Second, when merging down
a transactions changes into the global object index.  In either case, the result is a
new object index root that saved in the root block of the store.
</p>

<p>
The object index uses fixed size read-only or mutable views for its nodes.  The size
of a node is determined when the object index is created and is a fixed function of the 
branching factor of the b+tree.  The node views are backed by a ByteBuffer containing
the node data.  If the node is dirty in the context, then it is always mutable.  If a
node is clean in the context, then it is always immutable.  An attempt to write on a
clean node forces copy on write of the node and its ancenstors up to the root of the
tree.  In any case where the node has already been copied and is dirty within the
context, the mutable node is always used.  Therefore mutations of the object index 
never overwrite its historical state and always produce a new well-formed tree.  The
root of the new tree is recorded in the root block of the store during a commit, at
which point there is an atomic change in the addressable objects when restarting from
that root block.
</p>

<p>

A "reference" for a node of the object index is always an int64 value encoding a
allocation of contiguous slots on the journal.  The data in those slots are the
raw node contents.  Those slots are read and written as ByteBuffers.  The object
index node class knows how to access and interpret the contents of a ByteBuffer
as an index node with a given branching factor.
