     * Submit a task (asynchronous). Tasks will execute asynchronously in the
     * appropriate thread pool with as much concurrency as possible.
     * <p>
     * Note: Unisolated write tasks will NOT return before the next group commit
     * (exceptions may be thrown if the task fails or the commit fails). The
     * purpose of group commits is to provide higher throughput for writes on
     * the store by only syncing the data to disk periodically rather than after
     * every write. Group commits are scheduled by the {@link #commitService}.
     * The trigger conditions for group commits may be configured using
     * {@link ConcurrencyManager.Options}. If you are using the store in a single threaded context
     * then you may set {@link Options#WRITE_SERVICE_CORE_POOL_SIZE} to ONE (1)
     * which has the effect of triggering commit immediately after each
     * unisolated write. However, note that you can not sync a disk more than ~
     * 30-40 times per second so your throughput in write operations per second
     * will never exceed that for a single-threaded application writing on a
     * hard disk. (Your mileage can vary if you are writing on a transient store
     * or using a durable medium other than disk).
     * <p>
     * Note: The isolated indices used by a {@link IsolationEnum#ReadWrite}
     * transaction are NOT thread-safe. Therefore a partial order is imposed
     * over concurrent tasks for the <strong>same</strong> transaction that
     * seek to read or write on the same index(s). Full concurrency is allowed
     * when different transactions access the same index(s), but write-write
     * conflicts MAY be detected during commit processing.
     * <p>
     * Note: The following exceptions MAY be wrapped by {@link Future#get()} for
     * tasks submitted via this method:
     * <dl>
     * <dt>{@link ValidationError}</dt>
     * <dd>An unisolated write task was attempting to commit the write set for
     * a transaction but validation failed. You may retry the entire
     * transaction.</dd>
     * <dt>{@link RetryException}</dt>
     * <dd>An unisolated write task was a member of a commit group in which
     * some other write task failed. The entire commit group was discarded and
     * all tasks in the group were interrupted. You MAY retry the task.</dd>
     * <dt>{@link InterruptedException}</dt>
     * <dd>A task was interrupted during execution and before the task had
     * completed normally. You MAY retry the task, but note that this exception
     * is also generated when tasks are cancelled when the journal is being
     * {@link #shutdown()} after the timeout has expired or
     * {@link #shutdownNow()}. In either of these cases the task will not be
     * accepted by the journal.</dd>
