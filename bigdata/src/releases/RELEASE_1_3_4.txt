This is a critical fix release of bigdata(R). All users are encouraged to upgrade immediately.

Bigdata is a horizontally-scaled, open-source architecture for indexed data with an emphasis on RDF capable of loading 1B triples in under one hour on a 15 node cluster.  Bigdata operates in both a single machine mode (Journal), highly available replication cluster mode (HAJournalServer), and a horizontally sharded cluster mode (BigdataFederation).  The Journal provides fast scalable ACID indexed storage for very large data sets, up to 50 billion triples / quads.  The HAJournalServer adds replication, online backup, horizontal scaling of query, and high availability.  The federation provides fast scalable shard-wise parallel indexed storage using dynamic sharding and shard-wise ACID updates and incremental cluster size growth.  Both platforms support fully concurrent readers with snapshot isolation.

Distributed processing offers greater throughput but does not reduce query or update latency.  Choose the Journal when the anticipated scale and throughput requirements permit.  Choose the HAJournalServer for high availability and linear scaling in query throughput.  Choose the BigdataFederation when the administrative and machine overhead associated with operating a cluster is an acceptable tradeoff to have essentially unlimited data scaling and throughput.

See [1,2,8] for instructions on installing bigdata(R), [4] for the javadoc, and [3,5,6] for news, questions, and the latest developments. For more information about SYSTAP, LLC and bigdata, see [7].

Starting with the 1.0.0 release, we offer a WAR artifact [8] for easy installation of the single machine RDF database.  For custom development and cluster installations we recommend checking out the code from SVN using the tag for this release. The code will build automatically under eclipse.  You can also build the code using the ant script.  The cluster installer requires the use of the ant script.

Starting with the 1.3.0 release, we offer a tarball artifact [10] for easy installation of the HA replication cluster.  

You can download the WAR (standalone) or HA artifacts from:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/bigdata/

You can checkout this release from:

https://svn.code.sf.net/p/bigdata/code/tags/BIGDATA_RELEASE_1_3_4

Critical or otherwise of note in this minor release:

- #1036 (Journal leaks storage with SPARQL UPDATE and REST API)

New features in 1.3.x:

- Java 7 is now required.
- High availability [10].
- High availability load balancer.
- New RDF/SPARQL workbench.
- Blueprints API.
- RDF Graph Mining Service (GASService) [12].
- Reification Done Right (RDR) support [11].
- Property Path performance enhancements.
- Plus numerous other bug fixes and performance enhancements. 

Feature summary:

- Highly Available Replication Clusters (HAJournalServer [10])
- Single machine data storage to ~50B triples/quads (RWStore);
- Clustered data storage is essentially unlimited (BigdataFederation);
- Simple embedded and/or webapp deployment (NanoSparqlServer);
- Triples, quads, or triples with provenance (SIDs);
- Fast RDFS+ inference and truth maintenance;
- Fast 100% native SPARQL 1.1 evaluation;
- Integrated "analytic" query package;
- %100 Java memory manager leverages the JVM native heap (no GC);

Road map [3]:

- Column-wise indexing;
- Runtime Query Optimizer for quads; 
- Performance optimization for scale-out clusters; and
- Simplified deployment, configuration, and administration for scale-out clusters.

About bigdata: 

Bigdata(R) is a horizontally-scaled, general purpose storage and computing fabric for ordered data (B+Trees), designed to operate on either a single server or a cluster of commodity hardware. Bigdata(R) uses dynamically partitioned key-range shards in order to remove any realistic scaling limits - in principle, bigdata(R) may be deployed on 10s, 100s, or even thousands of machines and new capacity may be added incrementally without requiring the full reload of all data. The bigdata(R) RDF database supports RDFS and OWL Lite reasoning, high-level query (SPARQL), and datum level provenance.
