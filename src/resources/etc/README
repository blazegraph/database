	Server and client setups for ntp so that the cluster remains on a common
	clock.  The bigdata services rely on timestamps generated by the transaction
	service, which does not require a synchronize clock.  However, a synchronized
	clock is very convenient for logging and it makes it much easier to interpret
	the performance counters if they are are using timestamps drawn from a synchronized
	clock.
