This directory contains the configuration for the various Jini services.

The various services are:

  browser: A visualization tool for exploring Jini(TM) Network Technology communities. 
   reggie: Provides implementations of ServiceRegistrar. 
  fiddler: Provides the server side of an implementation of the lookup discovery service.
   mahalo: Provides implementations of the TransactionManager service.
  mercury: Provides implementations of the EventMailbox service.
     norm: Provides implementations of LeaseRenewalService.
outrigger: Provides implementation of a JavaSpaces(TM) technology-enabled service.

DO NOT attempt to start the Jini browser service from the bigdata
script.  The browser service requires a GUI.  An attempt to start
the browser from the bigdata script will cause the Jini service
start to fail.

You can always install Jini in the normal manner when logged in
with a GUI and then run the service browser from there.
