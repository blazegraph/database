This configuration is suitable for running a bigdata federation on a single
machine without using the installer (this is mainly used for testing).  The
configuration includes its own log4j configuration file is since parameter
substitution is not performed by the installer. You MUST start jini separately
for this configuration (the bundled jini configuration has metavariables which
are set by the installer, but the standalone configuration is designed to run
without the installer).
