# log4j client configuration.
#
# Note: This is the configuration that the application should use.  It
# sends log events to a log4j server using the [socketLogger].  This
# lets you aggregate log events across a cluster.  The log4j server
# handles things like rolling over the log files. 
#
# Note: If the network link to the log4j server goes down, then the
# application will block.  This makes that link a single point of
# failure.
#
# Note: If the log4j server goes down, then a warning will be logged
# on stderr for the application.
#
# Note: The application will proceed no faster than the TCP packets
# containing the log events that are being sent to the server. This
# should not be a problem unless very detailed logging is turned on.
#
# Note: The layout is NOT used by the SocketAppender.  The layout is
# decided on the other end by the log4j server's configuration file.
#
# You can also enable local logging.  You will have to choose a well
# known location for the log file since the same log4j configuration
# is used by all of the services (at least, by all of the same service
# type since you can not have a per-service instance override) in the
# federation.

##
# Configure appenders to be used.
##

# Setup relays log messages to a remote socket logger. The remote socket
# logger is then configured in [log4jServer.properties].  It will log ALL
# on the detailLog, ERROR+ on the errorLog and events on the eventLog. 
# However, it will ONLY log those messages which are logged here onto the
# [socketLogger].
# 
# Note: ERROR+ is also logged onto a local console so you can see any problems
# during startup when the socket logger might not be running.
#
# Note: You can control many of the logger levels (on a service-by-service
# bases) using remote JMX MBeans.

# overwrites.
#
# Note: if you don't have anything configured to accept the events

# socket.
#
# Note: One annoying feature of using this logger is that it DOES NOT
# use a layout.  This means that the MDC variables such as the hostname
# and serviceName ARE NOT available when the messages get logged.

# Under most systems, this configuration can be found in /etc/sysconfig/syslog
