# This file contains a list of URLs of interest when doing a post-mortem
# investigation.  The file is basically a list of URLs which could be used
# to demand the corresponding counters from the httpd service.  It can be
# submitted to a Java class that will extract the necessary performance
# counters from a directory containing counter set XML files.  This is done
# relatively efficiently - in a single pass over the XML files.
#
# In addition to the normal URL, you will typically want to specify the
# "file=" URL query parameter to name the output file.  You can also specify
# the desired MIME type using the "-mimeType=" URL query parameter.
