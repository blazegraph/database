This directory contains some tools which are useful for inspecting the
performance counters for a live (or post-mortem) bigdata instance.

bigdataServices_0h.xls

	An Excel worksheet.  The worksheet has several tabs. Each tab has one
	or more built-in HTTP requests which can be executed on demand.  The
	HTTP requests will fetch the current performance counters for a variety
	of different aspects of the system, update a table on the worksheet and
	update any graphs which depend on that table.
	
	This worksheet can be quite convenient to use once you have it setup
	for your cluster.  However, getting it setup for your cluster means
	that you need to review and possibly edit the queries (they are issued
	to localhost:8080 with the presumption that you are using SSH to port
	forward that request to the machine on the cluster running the load
	balancer), the data source ranges for the charts, and the various
	formulae which compute averages, maximums, etc.
	
	The "_0h" is my notation for the zeroth hour of a run.  I change the
	suffix over the course of a run to be "1h", "1d", etc.
	
clientIndices_0h.xls

	A worksheet which provides insight into the performance counters 
	maintained by the clients for their scale-out indices.  Among other
	things this provides an overview of the asynchronous writes by clients
	on the scale-out indices.  The performance counters are referred by
	clients to the load balancer and this worksheet resolves those performance
	counters against the load balancer in exactly the same manner as described
	above.
