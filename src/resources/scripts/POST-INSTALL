Note: This presumes that you have successfully installed bigdata using
the 'ant install' target.

In order to manage the bigdata run state you need to modify crontab
so that it will automatically execute:

@BIN_DIR@/bigdata

once per minute, reading the desired run state from:

@STATE_FILE@

You can destructively overwrite the @INSTALL_USER@ crontab on the
localhost using:

crontab @BIN_DIR@/crontab.user

YOU MUST DO THIS FOR EACH HOST IN THE CLUSTER WHICH WILL RUN A BIGDATA
SERVICE.

Next, edit @STATE_FILE@ and change the bigdata run state to 'start'.
If everything was configured correctly, the bigdata services will
soon start on all hosts in the cluster.

You can watch the progress using:

@BIN_DIR@/listServices.sh com.bigdata.service.jini.util.ListServices.repeatCount=0

You can look for errors using.

tail -f @STATE_LOG@ @ERROR_LOG@

You will typically see errors initially as some services can not start.
For example, if jini or zookeeper can not be discovered.  However, those
errors should go away once these services are running.

A good practice is to debug your configuration by running 'bigdata start'
directly from the appropriate user account on the individual machines,
especially those which will run jini, zookeeper, the bigdata transaction
service, the bigdata load balancer service, and the bigdata metadata
service.  Once you know that the basic services on those machines can
be started, you can change the run state for the entire federation and
the rest of your services should also come online.

Note: If you are doing an install as 'root' then you MUST issue the following
commands BEFORE you start the bigdata federation.  These commands set the
group and group permissions on the shared directory such that all hosts will
be able to read/write files in that directory.

	chown -R @INSTALL_USER@.@INSTALL_GROUP@ @NAS@
	chmod -R g+rwx @NAS@
	
This is only necessary when you installed as 'root' and want to run as 'root
as well, in which case you would probably specify "wheel" as the install group,
at least for Linux.
