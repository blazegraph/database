/** Bit-level output stream.
 *
 * <P>This class wraps any {@link OutputStream} so that you can treat it as
 * <em>bit</em> stream. Constructors and methods closely resemble those of
 * {@link OutputStream}. Data can be added to such a stream in several ways:
 * writing an integer or long in fixed-width, unary, &gamma;, &delta;, &zeta; and Golomb
 * coding, or providing a vector of bytes.
 * 
 * <P>This class can also {@linkplain #OutputBitStream(byte[]) wrap a byte
 * array}; this is much more lightweight than wrapping a {@link
 * it.unimi.dsi.fastutil.io.FastByteArrayOutputStream} wrapping the array, but overflowing the array
 * will cause an {@link java.io.IOException}.
 * 
 * <P>Note that when writing using a vector of bytes bits are written in the natural
 * way: the first bit is bit 7 of the first byte, the eightth bit is bit 0 of
 * the first byte, the ninth bit is bit 7 of the second byte and so on. When
 * writing integers using some coding, instead, the <em>lower</em> bits are considered
 * for coding (in the fixed-width case, the given number of bits, otherwise
 * the lower bits starting from the most significant one).
 *
 * <h3>The bit stream format</h3>
 *
 * <P>The bit streams written by this class are <em>big endian</em>. That is, 
 * the first bit of the stream is bit 7 of the first byte, the eightth bit
 * is bit 0 of the first byte, the ninth bit is bit 7 of the second byte and so on.
 *
 * <P>Blocks of bits (such as coded integers) are written <em>starting from the
 * most significant bit</em>. In other words, if you take the first bytes of a stream
 * and print them in binary you will see exactly the sequence of bits you have
 * written. In particular, if you write 32-bit integers you will get a stream
 * which is identical to the one produced by a {@link java.io.DataOutput}.
 *
 * <P>Additional features:
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 * <LI>This class provides an internal buffer. By setting a buffer of
 * length 0 at creation time, you can actually bypass the buffering system:
 * Note, however, that several classes providing buffering have synchronised
 * methods, so using a wrapper instead of the internal buffer is likely to lead
 * to a performance drop.
 *
 * <LI>To work around the schizophrenic relationship between streams and random
 * access files in {@link java.io}, this class provides a {@link #flush()}
 * method that byte-aligns the streams, flushes to the underlying byte stream
 * all data and resets the internal state. At this point, you can safely reposition
 * the underlying stream and write again afterwards. For instance, this is safe
 * and will perform as expected:
 * <PRE>
 * FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream( ... );
 * OutputBitStream obs = new OutputBitStream( fos );
 * ... write operations on obs ...
 * obs.flush();
 * fos.getChannel().position( ... );
 * ... other write operations on obs ...
 * </PRE>
 *
 * <P>As a commodity, an instance of this class will try to cast the underlying
 * byte stream to a {@link RepositionableStream} and to fetch by reflection the
 * {@link java.nio.channels.FileChannel} underlying the given output stream, in
 * this order.  If either reference can be successfully fetched, you can use
 * directly the {@link #position(long) position()} method with argument
 * <code>pos</code> with the same semantics of a {@link #flush()}, followed by
 * a call to <code>position(pos / 8)</code> (where the latter method belongs
 * either to the underlying stream or to its underlying file channel).  The
 * specified position must be byte aligned, as there is no clean way of reading
 * a fraction of a byte with the current APIs. However, since the reflective checks are quite
 * heavy they can be disabled using a {@linkplain OutputBitStream#OutputBitStream(OutputStream, boolean) suitable constructor}.
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * <P><STRONG>This class	 is not synchronised</STRONG>. If multiple threads
 * access an instance of this class concurrently, they must be synchronised externally.
