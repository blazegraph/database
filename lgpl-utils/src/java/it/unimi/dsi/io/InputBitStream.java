/** Bit-level input stream.
 *
 * <P>This class wraps any {@link InputStream} so that you can treat it as
 * <em>bit</em> stream.  Constructors and methods closely resemble those of
 * {@link InputStream}. Data can be read from such a stream in several ways:
 * reading an integer or long in fixed-width, unary, &gamma;, shifted &gamma;, &delta;, &zeta; and (skewed) 
 * Golomb coding, or reading a number of bits that will be stored in a vector of
 * bytes. There is limited support for {@link #mark(int)}/{@link #reset()}
 * operations.
 *
 * <P>This class can also {@linkplain #InputBitStream(byte[]) wrap a byte
 * array}; this is much more lightweight than wrapping a {@link
 * it.unimi.dsi.fastutil.io.FastByteArrayInputStream} wrapping the array. Overflowing the array
 * will cause an {@link java.io.EOFException}.
 * 
 * <P>Note that when reading using a vector of bytes bits are read in the
 * stream format (see {@link OutputBitStream}): the first bit is bit 7 of the
 * first byte, the eighth bit is bit 0 of the first byte, the ninth bit is bit
 * 7 of the second byte and so on. When reading integers using some coding,
 * instead, they are stored in the standard way, that is, in the <strong>lower</strong>
 * bits.
 *
 * <P>Additional features:
 * 
 * <UL>
 *
 * <LI>This class provides an internal buffer. By setting a buffer of
 * length 0 at creation time, you can actually bypass the buffering system:
 * Note, however, that several classes providing buffering have synchronised
 * methods, so using a wrapper instead of the internal buffer is likely to lead
 * to a performance drop.
 *
 * <LI>To work around the schizophrenic relationship between streams and random
 * access files in {@link java.io}, this class provides a {@link #flush()}
 * method that resets the internal state. At this point, you can safely reposition
 * the underlying stream and read again afterwards. For instance, this is safe
 * and will perform as expected:
 * <PRE>
 * FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream( ... );
 * InputBitStream ibs = new InputBitStream( fis );
 * ... read operations on ibs ...
 * ibs.flush();
 * fis.getChannel().position( ... );
 * ... other read operations on ibs ...
 * </PRE>
 *
 * <P>As a commodity, an instance of this class will try to cast the underlying byte
 * stream to a {@link RepositionableStream} and to fetch by reflection the {@link
 * java.nio.channels.FileChannel} underlying the given input stream, in this
 * order.  If either reference can be successfully fetched, you can use
 * directly the {@link #position(long) position()} method with argument
 * <code>pos</code> with the same semantics of a {@link #flush()}, followed by
 * a call to <code>position(pos / 8)</code> (where the latter method belongs
 * either to the underlying stream or to its underlying file channel), followed
 * by a {@link #skip(long) skip(pos % 8)}. However, since the reflective checks are quite
 * heavy they can be disabled using a {@linkplain InputBitStream#InputBitStream(InputStream, boolean) suitable constructor}.
 *
 * <li>Finally, this class implements partially the interface of a boolean iterator.
 * More precisely, {@link #nextBoolean()} will return the same bit as {@link #readBit()},
 * and also the same exceptions, whereas <em>{@link #hasNext()} will always return true</em>:
 * you must be prepared to catch a {@link java.lang.RuntimeException} wrapping an {@link IOException}
 * in case the file ends. It
 * is very difficult to implement completely an eager operator using a input-stream
 * based model.
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * <P><STRONG>This class is not synchronised</STRONG>. If multiple threads
 * access an instance of this class concurrently, they must be synchronised externally.
